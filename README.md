To read the code in app.py and run it with Streamlit, follow these steps:

1. Open the file:

You can open `app.py` in any text editor (like VS Code, Notepad, or PyCharm) to read and edit the code.

2. Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt).

3. Navigate to the folder containing `app.py` using the cd command. For example:
```
   cd "C:\Users\Salsa\OneDrive - Indosatooredoo Hutchison\Dokumen\fun_project_1_REAPYTHON3KJNMZ"
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app with:
  ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will start the Streamlit server and open your app in a web browser. You can then interact with the quiz as designed in your code.

 You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
